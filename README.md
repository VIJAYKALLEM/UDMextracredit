The above map compares indiviual landmark sites with icecream tuck noise complaints from April 1st to July 31st in Manhattan. We can see that there is a correlation between them. Many noise complaint are concentarted around these sites. Indiviual landmark sites such as museum, monuments attract a lot of tourists and children. So these location are perfect for ice cream trucks in Mahattan. So to let their customers know about their arrival, they often use classic bell ring and that may irritate people who live and bussines owners in the surrounding places beacuse a lot of noice may drive some customers away. This may be the reason for a lot the Icecream Truck Noise complaints around Indiviual Landmark Sites.

The above map compares Sidewalk Cafes with Barking Dog and other animal noise complaints from April 1st to July 31st in Manhattan. This is a weird comparison but it makes sense beacuse there is a some correlation between them. Some animal noise complaints are concentarted around sidewalk cafe locations. Poeple with pets usch as dogs, usual bring along their pets to their sidewalk cafe. Sometimes they may bark or make some noise and that would the drive the neighbours crazy. This may lead them to complain to the authorities about animal noises in their surroundings if the problem persists.
